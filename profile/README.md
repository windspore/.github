Hey, I‚Äôm **windspore** ‚Äî I design and build things on the internet.

Most of what I make is fast, clean, and simple ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a web app, an interface, or just some random idea I had at 2AM. I care a lot about how things look and even more about how they feel. ‚ú®

Lately, I‚Äôve been working on a new kind of social app ‚Äî something lighter, smoother, and way less chaotic than the usual stuff. It‚Äôs built with Next.js, Supabase, and shadcn/ui (with just enough chaos behind the scenes).

I spend half my time in code and half in design. Figma when I need to sketch it out, VS Code when I want to bring it to life. I think good design speaks before you read anything.

Always exploring new tools and better ways to build ‚Äî edge functions, subtle animations, and sometimes weird little experiments just for fun.

If you're into thoughtful design, clean code, or just building cool stuff ‚Äî stick around üôÇ
