Hey, Iâ€™m **windspore** â€” I design and build things on the internet.

Most of what I make is fast, clean, and simple â€” whether itâ€™s a web app, an interface, or just some random idea I had at 2AM. I care a lot about how things look and even more about how they feel. âœ¨

Lately, Iâ€™ve been working on a new kind of social app â€” something lighter, smoother, and way less chaotic than the usual stuff. Itâ€™s built with Next.js, Supabase, and shadcn/ui (with just enough chaos behind the scenes).

I spend half my time in code and half in design. Figma when I need to sketch it out, VS Code when I want to bring it to life. I think good design speaks before you read anything.

Always exploring new tools and better ways to build â€” edge functions, subtle animations, and sometimes weird little experiments just for fun.

If you're into thoughtful design, clean code, or just building cool stuff â€” stick around ðŸ™‚
